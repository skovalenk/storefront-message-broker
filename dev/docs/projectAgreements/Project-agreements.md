Here we have a list of agreements for the Alpha release in the scope of Storefront Project:

## Backward Compatibility policy 

### Storefront API
Mark interfaces as "API" but communicate to customers,
that we do not follow backward compatibility policy for Alpha release.  
Interfaces marked as "API" only with one purpose: highlight areas that can be used for extensibility

### Export API
WIP
