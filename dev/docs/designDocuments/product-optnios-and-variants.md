## Document purpose

Product options are a powerful instrument that allows a shopper to customize and (or) personalize a product before adding the product to the cart. 

Introduction of the storefront API brings us a unique opportunity to revisit the options management, address the existing limitation, and address known issues:

* Reduce redundancy caused by variants matrix creation. Magento creates variant and simple product for each intersection of options and option values selected to represent the configurable product. Not all the cases in real require a product creation, so extracting the variant as an entity could reduce system load caused by the number of products. 

* Allow to set up a dependency between the different options of a simple product based on previously selected option values. 
Currently, simple and bundle products do not support dependencies between option values.
An example, bundle product that represents a computer in your store may need to correlate the list of the available motherboards with the socket of the selected processor.

* Support grouped B2B prices at the options level. There is no way to specify a special price for a customer group for simple, downloadable,  and some of the bundled options of the product.

* Although all the options which represent product variants are pretty similar and most of them have similar properties, the options not generalized in Magento. As a result, it makes the option management more complicated, and for some cases such as option displaying, causes frontend rendering logic duplication. The ultimate goal after the options API revision is to build a generalized view that should to significantly reduce the complexity of the options domain for the storefront application.

### Taxonomy of the options

Due to their origin and structure options segregates on two main subtypes.

**Product Option Variants** & **Shopper Input Options**.

* The first subtype - **Product Option Variants**, is much often used and represents product configuration, which was predefined by a merchant.  And so, product customization could be described by the selection of these predefined options, which, in their turn, creates product variants, where each variant represents the selection of one or many option values.
This document will be focused on the first subtype, Product Option Variants, it just briefly covers the reasons for the options separation, due to the intention do not overload this document with information about the domain.

* Another subtype **Shopper Input Option**s represent an approach to personalizing a product before adding it to the cart by adding custom images, entering text so on. Gift Cards with customer-defined amounts could be treated as one of the cases the Shopper Input Options. These subtype of options do not provide any predefined values, it provides constraints for the input instead like, max number of symbols, a range for amount, or allowed extensions for files. Shopper Input options do not have variants, could not be associated with a product or inventory record, but may have a reference on price. Due to the excessive list of differences from product options variants, this option subtype is out of the document. The document just points out that the options segregation by the mentioned above criteria should happen, especially to respect checkout API that we released recently. Anyway, Shopper Input Options should have their own representation as a product top-level property.

*Note: Most of the logic that we use to associate with  Magento product types (configurable, bundle, downloadable, etc) in fact is the logic of the different options.*

### Definitions

* **ProductOption** - represents a product characteristic which allows editing before adding to cart.
ProductOption has to have a label, information on how option values should be displayed,
and is this option mandatory.  
* **ProductOptionValue**s - belong to a particular option as to a group and represent selections which allowed by the option.
Option value could by display label, also one or may values could be pre-selected.  
* **ProductVariant** - represent the final selection of one or multiple option values that will characterize the customized product in a shopping cart.
Depends on the business scenario, a particular product variant could be linked with an existing product,
with a price, or an inventory record, or no be linked to any.
Even with no entities associated with the variant, it still has great value for a catalog because the presence of the variant says that such composition of options and their values described by the variant makes sense so that it can be purchased.

## Actual usages

The application distinguishes two approaches to manage options:

**Approach 1, "One to many"**: Multiple options selections lead a shopper to a selection of the single variation.

Example: configurable products
![](https://app.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/26cd0b67-13c1-44e4-8b61-cada36c67010/image.png)

**Approach 2, "One to one"**: The selection of multiple options leads to multiple product variants.

Examples: bundle product, customizable product, downloadable products.
![](https://app.lucidchart.com/publicSegments/view/fea3f950-6f2f-4e46-90e4-f8ee4b6877f7/image.png)
Both of approaches could be used together.

Example: configurable product with customizable option.

## Modeling Options and Variants Data Objects

The great advantage of Magento 2 - modularity was not a real thing for the product options during Magento the lifetime.
Since times of Magento 1.x option prices coupled into options, inventory records ignored even options with assigned SKUs.
The only thing that had to play it together "Bundle" product was designed too complex to treat it as universal solution it had to become.

That's why, with the storefront project, we have an opportunity to resolve it.

Taking into account the Magento experience (good, bad, ugly) and solutions proposed on the market.
I could define the set of requirements that I would want to see in a new options implementation:

* Options are a predefined list of possible product customizations. This list belongs to the product exclusively; it is measurable, and limited only by the business requirements. So it always easy to return even a complete set of options for rendering PDP initially. 

* Variants are a unique intersection of one or may option values. The variant matrix does not belong to a product as property. The variant matrix is stored managed separately from products. The primary role of variants is to distinguish the possible intersections of options from impossible.
The variants matrix is never meant to be returned to the storefront as is. The variants matrix will be used for filtering options allowed at the storefront after one or many options selected.

### Variants, Prices & Inventory
Variants could link the options intersection with a product, a price, or an inventory record but any of these relations is not mandatory.
So, a variant can request data from the different domains if such data assigned.
Such a decision brings us unseen before the level of the flexibility, since there is no difference between product price and variant price, and as the consequence variant price, could be included in B2B pricing.

We do not have such behaviors either Magento 1 or 2 and as a result, the whole layer of product types such as bundle and downloadable do not support B2B prices or special prices for options.

The link on a product that exists in the same domain could be done through the shared ID, which as for me makes sense since I can see a possible scenario when variation that initially had only a price will be "promoted" to a product. For example due to integration reasons, to pass additional attributes data along with variant to Google Merchant Center.

### Enhanced option values

To reach a better user experience,
the option could be extended with an image that represents it 
or info URL that provides additional information about option value.

[Magento: Swatches](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/catalog/swatches.html)

[Magento: Downloadable products, options with samples](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/catalog/product-create-downloadable.html)

Both types of resources could be specified as attributes of `ProductOptionValue`.

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

message Product {
    repeated ProductOption options = 100;
}

message ProductOptionValue {
    string id = 1;
    string label = 2;
    string sortOrder = 3;
    string isDefault = 4;
    string imageUrl = 5;
    string infoUrl = 6;
}

message ProductOption {
    string id = 1;
    string label = 2;
    string sortOrder = 3;
    string isRequired = 4;
    string renderType = 6;
    repeated ProductOptionValue values = 5;
}

message ProductVariant {
    repeated string optionValueId = 1;
    string id = 2;
    string productIdentifierInPricing = 500; #*
    string productIdentifierInInventory = 600; #*
}
#* to avoid unnecessary network calls the variant has to know does it have a link on another domain,  type, and proper name of a field representing this link TBD.
```

### Explaining data and operations through the pseudo SQL

Lets review pseudo SQL schema, which implements the picture described above.
This is not the instruction for implementation, tables intentionally do not have all the fields of data objects.
The example proposed to show the relations and operations that we have in the domain.

```sql
create table products (
    object_id char(36) not null,
    data json not null,
    primary key (object_id)
);
```
Table `products` stores registry of products.

```sql
create table product_variant_matrix (
    value_id char(36) not null,
    object_id char(36) not null,
    primary key (value_id, object_id)
);

alter table product_variant_matrix
    add foreign key fk_product_variant_matrix_value_id (value_id) references product_option_values(value_id);
```

`product_variant_matrix` - Stores the correlation between option values and variants, by using this correlation, we can say which of option combination is real.

The following script models data from the picture above.

```sql
set @product_data :=  '
{
  "id": "t-shirt",
  "options": {
    "color": {
      "label": "Color",
      "values": {
        "red": {
          "label": "Red"
        },
        "green": {
          "label": "Green"
        }
      }
    },
    "size" : {
      "label": "Size",
      "values": {
        "m": {
          "label": "M"
        },
        "l": {
          "label": "L"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
';

insert into products (object_id, data) values ('t-shirt', @product_data);

insert into product_variant_matrix (value, object_id)
values
       ('t-shirt:options.size.values.l', 'l-red'), ('t-shirt:options.color.values.red', 'l-red'),
       ('t-shirt:options.size.values.m', 'm-red'), ('t-shirt:options.color.values.red', 'm-red'),
       ('t-shirt:options.size.values.m', 'm-green'), ('t-shirt:options.color.values.green', 'm-green')
;
```

So far, all looks pretty nice with such an approach product may return information for all available options with the single request.
```sql
mysql> select
    ->     json_pretty(data->>'$.options.*') as options
    -> from products p where p.object_id = 't-shirt'\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
options: [
  {
    "label": "Size",
    "values": {
      "l": {
        "label": "L"
      },
      "m": {
        "label": "M"
      }
    }
  },
  {
    "label": "Color",
    "values": {
      "red": {
        "label": "Red"
      },
      "green": {
        "label": "Green"
      }
    }
  }
]
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

Let's assume that we have chosen one option value from the list.
Starting this point we can look into variants to analyze remaining options.
From the proposed example, we have chosen "Size": "M".

```sql
mysql> select t.*
    -> from (
    ->     select
    ->         object_id, value, count(1) over (partition by object_id) as weight
    ->     from product_variant_matrix
    -> ) as t
    -> where value in ('t-shirt:options.size.values.m');
+-----------+-------------------------------+--------+
| object_id | value                         | weight |
+-----------+-------------------------------+--------+
| m-green   | t-shirt:options.size.values.m |      2 |
| m-red     | t-shirt:options.size.values.m |      2 |
+-----------+-------------------------------+--------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

```

As you may see, our selection has matched two variants.
Both variants have weight two,
which means that we have to match at least two values to match the whole variant,
but we used only one,
which means that we can request the remaining options,
that correspond to our current selection.

```sql
mysql> select distinct value
    -> from product_variant_matrix pvm
    -> where pvm.object_id in ('m-green', 'm-red')
    ->   and value not in ('t-shirt:options.size.values.m');
+------------------------------------+
| value                              |
+------------------------------------+
| t-shirt:options.color.values.green |
| t-shirt:options.color.values.red   |
+------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

The remaining option values could be found in values assigned to the matched variants minus values that we selected at the previous step.

```sql
mysql> select
    ->     json_pretty(
    ->         json_extract(
    ->             data,
    ->             '$.options.color.label',
    ->             '$.options.color.values.green',
    ->             '$.options.color.values.red'
    ->         )
    ->     ) as options
    -> from products\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
options: [
  "Color",
  {
    "label": "Green"
  },
  {
    "label": "Red"
  }
]
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

*Note: To achieve more advanced behavior, the variants could be "uneven" inside the single product.
 They may have different "weight".
 For instance, you would like to track only t-shirts XL: size separately for some reason (a different price or stock). The example above focused on covering the main case scenario. Still, the approach, overall, is meant to support extending the logic of resolving option values onto a variant under the hood.*

### Storefront API

#### Import API

* Product import API should accept options as a part of the Product message.
* Because product variant matrix not more belongs to Product message, we have to design import API, which will accept ProductVariant messages.

#### Read API

As were mentioned previously, options belong to a product, full options list can be retrieved from a product.

Variants do not expose at the storefront but help to filter options after one or several variants were selected.

Such behavior was recently [approved for configurable product](https://github.com/magento/architecture/pull/394).
And since the most complex part of designing API was done the main thing we have to do in the scope of this 
chapter - generalize the behavior to support not only configurable products.

As an input our API has to accept option values which were selected by a shopper.
With the response API has to return:
* List of options and option values that remains avaialble.
* List of images & videos that should be used on PDP.
* List of products that were exactly matched by the selected options.
```proto
message OptionSelection
{
    repeated string values = 2; 
}
message OptionResponse {
    repeated ProductOption options = 1;
    repeated MediaGallery gallery = 2;
    repeated ProductVarinat matchedVariants = 3;
}

service SearchService {
  rpc GetOptions(OptionSelection) returns (OptionResponse);
}
```

## Proposal cross references

This proposal continues the idea of product options unification and aligned with previous design decisions that were made in this area.
